when the market has moved sharply lower in a price waterfall and a bearish trend, supported by masses of volume, this is a buying climax. It is the wholesalers who are buying and the retail traders who are panic selling. A buying climax for us represents an opportunity.

Whether the price has been validated by the volume, or whether there is an anomaly with the price. If the price is validated then that confirms a continuation of the price behaviour. By contrast if there is an anomaly, then this is sending a signal of a potential change. These are the only things we are constantly searching for in VPA.

The first candle forms, a narrow spread up candle with low volume, which is fine. The volume validates the price, no anomaly here. The second candle then begins to form, and on close inspection we note that the spread of this is wider than the first, and based on Wyckoff's rule, we expect to see greater volume that on the first bar, which is indeed the case. So the up trend is valid, the volume has validated the price on both candles.

Testing is one of the key tools that the insiders use, in all markets. Like everything else in VPA, it is a simple concept, based on simple logic, and once we understand the concept of accumulation and the structure on the chart, we will begin to see tests occurring in all time frames and in all markets. It is one of the most powerful signals you will see, as it is the insiders sending a clear message that the market is about to break out and move higher.

The victim triangle consists of three predictable sequences: 1.​The Nice Guy gives to others hoping to get something in return. 2.​When it doesn’t seem that he is getting as much as he gives or he isn’t getting what he expected, he feels frustrated and resentful. Remember, the Nice Guy is the one keeping score, and he isn’t totally objective. 3.​When this frustration and resentment builds up long enough, it spills out in the form of rage attacks, passive-aggressive behavior, pouting, tantrums, withdrawing, shaming, criticizing, blaming, even physical abuse. Once the cycle has been completed, it usually just begins all over again.

This frustration is due to the reality that, in general, women view men who try to please them as weak and hold these men in contempt. Most women do not want a man who tries to please them—they want a man who knows how to please himself. Women consistently share with me that they don’t want a passive, pleasing wimp. They want a man—someone with his balls still intact.

Google’s Target CPA algorithm will look to spend your entire budget, so long as it averages to your defined Target CPA. If your Target CPA is $75, Google is willing to buy a conversion for $100, so long as it buys another for $50 within that same conversion window. Facebook’s Target Cost algorithm, however, will only bid on auctions where it believes the actual CPA will be close to $75.

In order to alter our conversion tracking to reflect this data, we’d simply map out the logic and code this into the backend of the site. As a customer checks out on the site, the conversion tracking code will have to run a series of if/else statements, including “If cart includes bed frame AND sofa, THEN increase Google Ads conversion value by 125 percent.” ($200 + 125 percent = $450) This is a simplified version of what would be sent to a developer.

The bio is an area for you to sell yourself. I like to keep mine a little funny, such as saying “we can tell people we met at the library.” Put some hobbies you have, where you’ve lived, your occupation, and anything else unique about yourself. Sometimes girls will message you first, and this gives them something to talk with you about. A great item to put in your bio is “two truths and a lie.” This is an instant conversation starter with girls who decide to message you first. Then girls can guess which one of the three items you put down is a lie, and it gives you both something to talk about.

While there is no set number, I would suggest sending a minimum of 7 messages (14 including her's) before asking for her phone number or Snapchat ID. And these are good messages, not “hey.” Messages where you ask her opinion on things. Messages where you talk about her photos. Messages where you get to know her. Seven “hey’s” does not count. Also, you should allow a minimum of one week from your first Tinder message before asking for her Snapchat or number. Again, this all goes back to not appearing too interested too soon.

nation’s world-beating industry and design. The Great Exhibition was more exciting and dramatic than a thousand Microsoft or Apple launch events.

In fact, it is only going to get worse as you keep pushing yourself further and further. Resistance and rejection will be a part of your life, so get used to it.

caressing her body with a wild look in your eyes but then struggling with yourself to pull away and stop This works so well because she likes that you are turned on but NOT needy. You are in CONTROL of yourself and your body. In other words, she interprets your self-restraint in this moment of extreme sexual desire as proof that you are safe to be with. Obviously, over excitement and blatant neediness is a huge warning sign not to sleep with someone.
